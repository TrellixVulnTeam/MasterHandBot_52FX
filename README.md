# MasterHandBot
This is Master Hand. We aim for it to be simple (wow), painless (amazing), and easy to edit. It's a leaderboard and point system Discord bot for use in competitive Super Smash Bros. games.
It was made specifically for The Battlefields discord server. 

# How To Run
You will need to install some things before this will run on your machine (most easily by writing a batch program to run it automatically). However, I'm usually the one who runs it.

1. Node.js. (https://nodejs.org/en/)
2. The Discord.js library. (https://github.com/discordjs/guide)
3. An IDE such as Visual Studio Code.
4. The better-sqlite3 library ("npm better-sqlite3" in a command prompt) 

Then, all you need to do is run index.js. Have fun!
